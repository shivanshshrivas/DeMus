Decentralized Music Application

## Use the App:

## Features:
DeMus (Decentralized Music Application) is a react based application which lets artists upload their music risk free. It uses blockchain and IPFS to prevent single point of failure, so that artists don't have to do record maintanence. It also ensures that the talent of the artist is secured by creating a fingerprint of their music and storing it on blockchain. Everytime someone tries to upload a music, the application checks if there's already a similar fingerprint on chain or not and only lets you upload songs which are unique to the platform. This makes sure that uploaded songs aren't cpoied or republished without artists' knowledge.

The platform also has its own tokens called $VIBE tokens. When you register, you get 10,000 $VIBE tokens by default and you can always mint more if you're running out. One of the most essential feature of the application is that you can use $VIBE to tip the artists directly which eliminates all the intermediaries who take a big chunk from artists' hardwork. 

There's another section 'My Music' which keeps a track of songs that you uploaded so that you always know how far you've come.

Enjoy the App

## For the Nerds - How I built it and how it works
Here's a breakdown of different components:

### User-Authentication
For user authentication, I've used Firebase which creates a document of your email, username and creates a unique user id when you sign-up which is then retrieved when you login.

### Front-End
For the front-end I've used ReactJS with MaterialUI, trying to keep it simple and as much abstracted as possible, not showing any wierd alerts, pop-ups or scary json strings. For interaction with backend, I've used Axios (DeMus/frontend/src/services/api.js)

### Back-End
For backend I've used NodeJS and ExpressJS for handling server-side operations and defining API endpoints. I've used CORS to send mutli-part data to blockchain.js, and Multer to save files temporarily in uploads for fingerprint generation.

### Fingerprint Generation
For fingerprint generation, I've used a C library called chromaprint (github.com/acousticid/chromaprint) which implements a custom algorithm for extracting fingerprints from any audio source. I'm using the linux version of this library because my backend runs on a linux based OS but for testing and local running I used windows version (Download - acousticid.org/chromaprint).

### Blockchain
For smart contracts, I have two primary smart contracts, Vibe.sol which was developed using OpenZeppelin. It creates $VIBE tokens for the platform set at default 10,000. And second one is RegisterMusic.sol which has primary functions:
- registerTrack: registers a MusicTrack with parameters: title(from the upload form), artist (username signed up with), ipfsHash(points to pinata memory location of file), fingerprint(generated by chromaprint), account(the public address which signed the transaction)
- getUserTrack: gets tracks uploaded by the user's wallet
- getTrack: gets track using fingerprint
- getAllTracks: gets all the tracks on chain (for Discover page)
- searchTracks: searches track by query given (by title or artist)

File storage is handled by Pinata
